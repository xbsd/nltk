[Synset('car.n.01')]

# Thus, motorcar has just one possible meaning and it is identified as car.n.01, the first noun sense of car. The entity car.n.01 is called a synset, or "synonym set", a collection of synonymous words (or "lemmas"):

>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemma_names
['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']

# Each word of a synset can have several meanings, e.g., car can also signify a train carriage, a gondola, or an elevator car. However, we are only interested in the single meaning that is common to all words of the above synset. Synsets also come with a prose definition and some example sentences:

>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').definition
'a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine'
>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').examples
['he needs a car to get to work']

# We can get all the lemmas for a given synset [1], look up a particular lemma [2], get the synset corresponding to a lemma [3], and get the "name" of a lemma [4]:

>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemmas [1]
[Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.01.auto'), Lemma('car.n.01.automobile'), Lemma('car.n.01.machine'), Lemma('car.n.01.motorcar')]

>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile') [2]
Lemma('car.n.01.automobile')

>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').synset [3]
Synset('car.n.01')

>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').name [4]
'automobile'

>>> wn.synsets('car')
[Synset('car.n.01'), Synset('car.n.02'), Synset('car.n.03'), Synset('car.n.04'),
Synset('cable_car.n.01')]

>>> for synset in wn.synsets('car'):
...     print synset.lemma_names
...
['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']
['car', 'railcar', 'railway_car', 'railroad_car']
['car', 'gondola']
['car', 'elevator_car']
['cable_car', 'car']

# For convenience, we can access all the lemmas involving the word car as follows.

>>> wn.lemmas('car')
[Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.02.car'), Lemma('car.n.03.car'),
Lemma('car.n.04.car'), Lemma('cable_car.n.01.car')]

# The WordNet Hierarchy

# WordNet synsets correspond to abstract concepts, and they don't always have corresponding words in English. These concepts are linked together in a hierarchy. Some concepts are very general, such as Entity, State, Event â€” these are called unique beginners or root synsets. Others, such as gas guzzler and hatchback, are much more specific.

# WordNet makes it easy to navigate between concepts. For example, given a concept like motorcar, we can look at the concepts that are more specific; the (immediate) hyponyms.

>>> motorcar = wn.synset('car.n.01')
>>> types_of_motorcar = motorcar.hyponyms()
>>> types_of_motorcar[26]
Synset('ambulance.n.01')
>>> sorted([lemma.name for synset in types_of_motorcar for lemma in synset.lemmas])
['Model_T', 'S.U.V.', 'SUV', 'Stanley_Steamer', 'ambulance', 'beach_waggon', 'beach_wagon', 'bus', 'cab', 'compact', 'compact_car', 'convertible',...]

# We can also navigate up the hierarchy by visiting hypernyms. Some words have multiple paths, because they can be classified in more than one way. There are two paths between car.n.01 and entity.n.01 because wheeled_vehicle.n.01 can be classified as both a vehicle and a container.

>>> motorcar.hypernyms()
[Synset('motor_vehicle.n.01')]
>>> paths = motorcar.hypernym_paths()
>>> len(paths)
2
>>> [synset.name for synset in paths[0]]
['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',
'instrumentality.n.03', 'container.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',
'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01']

# We can get the most general hypernyms (or root hypernyms) of a synset as follows:

>>> motorcar.root_hypernyms()
[Synset('entity.n.01')]

More Lexical Relations

# Hypernyms and hyponyms are called lexical relations because they relate one synset to another. These two relations navigate up and down the "is-a" hierarchy. Another important way to navigate the WordNet network is from items to their components (meronyms) or to the things they are contained in (holonyms). For example, the parts of a tree are its trunk, crown, and so on; the part_meronyms(). The substance a tree is made of includes heartwood and sapwood; the substance_meronyms(). A collection of trees forms a forest; the member_holonyms():

>>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').part_meronyms()
[Synset('burl.n.02'), Synset('crown.n.07'), Synset('stump.n.01'),
Synset('trunk.n.01'), Synset('limb.n.02')]

To see just how intricate things can get, consider the word mint, which has several closely-related senses. We can see that mint.n.04 is part of mint.n.02 and the substance from which mint.n.05 is made.

>>> for synset in wn.synsets('mint', wn.NOUN):
...     print synset.name + ':', synset.definition
...
batch.n.02: (often followed by `of') a large number or amount or extent
mint.n.02: any north temperate plant of the genus Mentha with aromatic leaves and small mauve flowers

There are also relationships between verbs. For example, the act of walking involves the act of stepping, so walking entails stepping. Some verbs have multiple entailments:

>>> wn.synset('walk.v.01').entailments()
[Synset('step.v.01')]
>>> wn.synset('eat.v.01').entailments()
[Synset('swallow.v.01'), Synset('chew.v.01')]

Some lexical relationships hold between lemmas, e.g., antonymy:

>>> wn.lemma('supply.n.02.supply').antonyms()
[Lemma('demand.n.02.demand')]
>>> wn.lemma('rush.v.01.rush').antonyms()
[Lemma('linger.v.04.linger')]
